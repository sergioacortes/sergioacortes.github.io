I would like to start writting the first post explaining the tool I decided to use to publish posts. What you will find is a comprehensive overview of how to install, create and publish your own site using Jekyll and Github pages. Don't considere it an step by step tutorial but a set of resources to publish yout own web site.

Let start with the begining, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. No database is required, you just need to write your post in your favorite markup language, change the look and feel of your site using a template, set the data displayed on the page, and more.

But, before start, let's enumerate the requirements and the installation process.
