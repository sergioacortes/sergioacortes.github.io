I would like to start writing the first post explaining the tool I decided to use to publish posts. What you will find is a comprehensive overview of how to install, create and publish your own site using Jekyll and GitHub pages. Don't consider it a step-by-step tutorial but a set of resources to publish your own website.

Let start with the beginning, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. No database is required, you just need to write your post in your favorite markup language, change the look and feel of your site using a template, set the data displayed on the page, and more.

But, before start, let's enumerate the requirements and the installation process. 

## Requirements

For requirements, please read the official requirements documentation.

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) version 2.5.0 or higher
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Installation
